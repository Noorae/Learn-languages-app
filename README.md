## Description

The Learn-Languages-App is a project focused on creating a language learning application for kids.
The application has word pairs in different languages, english, swedish and korean, and the user can
use the app to guess those words.

Teachers have their own admin view, where they can access the words
and add, delete or modify the word pairs.

The focus is to have a simple UI and an easy to approach way to learn.
